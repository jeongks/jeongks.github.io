            Global object:  any variables that are created with global scope are properties of global object. In a browser environment the global object is the window object. <br>
            <br>
            Browser Object Model(BOM)<br>
                This is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. We can find dimensions of the screen. With the BOM we can create pop ups on window.<br>
            This is only working in a browser environment. JavaScript can be run in different environments. Assigning the variable global scope.<br>
            <br>
            Global variables are for global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window object.<br>
            To make a global variable, I need to make a variable without using let, var, or const.<br>
            globalVariable = 6;<br>

            Location.protocol: return with which protocol is used for the URL.<br>
            Window.location.protocol  >> “https:”<br>
            Location.host: return the domain address of URL. And port number<br>
            Window.location.host >> www.byui.edu and port. ** if the port is 80, it will be omitted since default is port 80.<br>
            Location.hostname: return with domain address.<br>
            Window.location.hostname >> www.byui.edu<br>
            Location.port: return with port number<br>
            Window.location.port >> port number<br>
            Location.pathname: return with a string of path that follows the domain<br>
            <br>
            Location.search: return a sting that starts with a ‘?’<br>
            <br>

            Window.history.go(1);  // goes forward 1 page<br>
            Window.history.go(0) // reloads the current page<br>
            Window.history.go(-1) // goes back 1 page<br>
            <br>
            Window.open() method can open a page with URL.<br>
            Open(param, param, param)<br>
